### Purpose:
Following a Street Fighter Game Tutorial on Youtube that uses Javascript and HTML Canvas

**Credits:** shezzor's Dev Corner <br>
**Playlist:** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf9yt-2olqyLxr-vouWl-qk4toUfjF2LC

<br>

**Other Notes:** 
- I will occasionally make some alterations to the code, such as separating the CSS into its own file.
- Since Part 1 is an introduction to the project, Part 2 is when the coding begins. I'll refer to Part 2 as Part 1 in my commit messages (e.g., to indicate that the code for Part 1 - Canvas Setup is completed).
